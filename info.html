          <h2>Why Do Ambulances Get Delayed in Traffic?</h2>
          <p>
            Ambulances race against seconds in emergencies. In city traffic,
            reaching the destination on time isn't always possible. One major
            reason is that drivers notice the ambulance too late or don't know
            how to react.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sirens alone are often not enough. Closed windows, loud music, busy
            intersections, and heavy traffic delay detection. That delay can
            have serious consequences in life-threatening cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another problem is that drivers struggle to move in a coordinated
            way. When they don't know where the ambulance is coming from, some
            make wrong maneuvers and the traffic jams even more.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where an <strong>ambulance alert system</strong> steps in.
            By informing drivers early, it's possible to clear a path before the
            ambulance arrives. That raises the ambulance's speed and reduces
            traffic chaos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Travaxen aims to create early awareness in traffic as an ambulance
            alert system designed to solve this problem.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="detail-card">
          <h2>How Does the Ambulance Alert System Work?</h2>
          <p>
            An ambulance alert system detects the ambulance's position and sends
            advance notifications to nearby drivers. The goal is to inform
            drivers before the siren is even heard.
          </p>
          <p>
            These systems typically work based on location, distance, and
            timing. When the ambulance enters a certain radius, an informative
            alert is sent to drivers. As the ambulance gets closer, the urgency
            of the alerts increases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Travaxen's approach is to warn drivers clearly without causing
            panic. The first alert is calm and informative. When the ambulance
            gets closer, a second alert boosts the driver's attention.
          </p>
          <p>This helps drivers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand which direction the ambulance is coming from</li>
            <li>Change lanes in time</li>
            <li>Avoid sudden maneuvers in traffic</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As a result, the ambulance moves faster and accidents are prevented.
            For modern cities, an ambulance alert system is not a luxury but a
            necessity.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="detail-card">
          <h2>Why Aren't Sirens Enough?</h2>
          <p>
            Sirens have long been the basic warning method ambulances use. But
            in today's cities, this method alone is not sufficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern vehicles are well insulated. Closed windows and loud music
            make sirens harder to perceive. In city noise, it's also difficult
            to tell the siren's direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another issue is reaction time. By the time a driver hears the
            siren, it is often late. Sudden braking and uncontrolled maneuvers
            can cause crashes.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why early warning is critical. An
            <strong>ambulance alert system</strong> buys drivers time. They know
            what to do beforehand and clear the way calmly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Travaxen augments the siren with an ambulance alert system to
            improve both safety and traffic flow.
